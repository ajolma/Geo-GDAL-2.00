Geo::GDAL is a Perl API to GDAL, which has various branches with patch level releases.
The version number of the CPAN version must increase, so it must always be the version
for the latest patch level release of the newest branch. The first five digits of 
the version number are from GDAL and the digits after denote the Perl module patch level.
